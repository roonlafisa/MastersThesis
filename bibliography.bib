Inspired by those theoretical works, the experimental realization of electromagnetic invisibility cloaks has been reported at various electromagnetic frequencies. All the invisibility cloaks demonstrated thus far, however, have relied on nano- or micro-fabricated artificial composite materials with spatially varying electromagnetic properties, which limit the size of the cloaked region to a few wavelengths. Here, we report the first realization of a macroscopic volumetric invisibility cloak constructed from natural birefringent crystals. The cloak operates at visible frequencies and is capable of hiding, for a specific light polarization, three-dimensional objects of the scale of centimetres and millimetres. Our work opens avenues for future applications with macroscopic cloaking devices.},

abstract = {Recent demonstrations of negative refraction utilize three-dimensional collections of discrete periodic scatterers to synthesize artificial dielectrics with simultaneously negative permittivity and permeability. In this paper, we propose an alternate perspective on the design and function of such materials that exploits the well-known L-C distributed network representation of homogeneous dielectrics. In the conventional low-pass topology, the quantities L and C represent a positive equivalent permeability and permittivity, respectively. However, in the dual configuration, in which the positions of L and C are simply interchanged, these equivalent material parameters assume simultaneously negative values. Two-dimensional periodic versions of these dual networks are used to demonstrate negative refraction and focusing; phenomena that are manifestations of the fact that such media support a propagating fundamental backward harmonic. We hereby present the characteristics of these artificial transmission-line media and propose a suitable means of implementing them in planar form. We then present circuit and full-wave field simulations illustrating negative refraction and focusing, and the first experimental verification of focusing using such an implementation.},

abstract = {Low-cost multilayer antennas are proposed for the next-generation automotive radar systems at millimeter waves. The antennas consist of a multilayer pillbox leaky-wave antenna structure where the feeding (integrated horn) and radiating parts are connected by a quasi-optical system made by an integrated parabola and several coupling slots (pillbox transition). In addition, a scanning capability is obtained by displacing the feeding part in the focal plane of the pillbox transition. Three prototypes with different feed locations have been manufactured and tested. The antenna stack-up consists of two Rogers 5880 substrates piled up by a diffusion bonding process. The integrated horn and pillbox transition are synthesized by perfect vertical metallic walls and closely spaced metallic pins, respectively. The E- and H-plane radiation patterns measured in the 74-78-GHz band show an average half-power beamwidth of about 11.5° and 5.5°, respectively, and sidelobe levels better than -15 dB up to a scan angle of 18°. The measured gains are about 24 dB around 77 GHz, resulting in a total efficiency higher than 50{\%}.},

abstract = {This second part of a two-paper sequence deals with the uniform asymptotic description of the Green's function of an infinite slot printed between two different homogeneous dielectric media. Starting from the magnetic current derived in Part I, the dyadic Green's function is first formulated in integral form in both spectral and spatial domains; next, the asymptotic solution for the vector potential is evaluated asymptotically. The asymptotic ray-field is structured in three contributions: a spherical wave radiated by the source (space wave), a conical leaky wave, and a lateral wave. These contributions are first introduced by the stationary phase method applied to the space-domain radiation integral. From this approach it is seen that the lateral wave contribution is negligible in actual configurations. Next, a rigorous uniform asymptotic evaluation of the radiated field is formulated in the spectral domain by using a steepest descent path deformation which accounts for the vicinity of the pole to the saddle point. Through this rigorous asymptotics, the domain of existence of the leaky-wave is found to be limited by a conical shadow boundary which deviates from that defined by the stationary phase regime. Along this conical shadow boundary, phase matching occurs between space and leaky wave, which facilitates the transition mechanism between the two wave types. This transition occurs inside a conical transition region with elliptical cross section. The interference between space and leaky waves from the near to the far zone are discussed by means of illustrative examples, which also confirm the accuracy of the asymptotics.},

The proposed antenna has features wherein a movable dielectric slab is placed above the CRLH LW antenna, and the radiation angle can be steered by changing the distance between the slab and the antenna using compact actuators. Moreover, slots are added to the antenna to control the aperture amplitude distribution of the array antenna in order to enhance aperture efficiency. A prototype CRLH LW antenna has been fabricated with these slots, and backward-to-forward beam scanning characteristics at 76 GHz have been demonstrated successfully by measurement. A wide scanning angle from 73 to 114 deg. has been achieved experimentally. The aperture efficiency is 25.3 {\%}},

abstract = {Automotive radars are on the market since 1999, both in the frequency range around 24 GHz as well as 76.5 GHz, with a new frequency band ranging from 77 to 81 GHz intended for medium and short-range sensors. The choice and design of the respective sensor antennas are determined by the requirement for high gain and low loss combined with small size and depth for vehicle integration, the challenges by the millimeter-wave frequency range, and a great cost pressure for this commercial application. Consequently, planar antennas are dominating in the lower frequency range, while lens and reflector antennas had been the first choice at 76.5 GHz, partly in folded configurations. With increasing requirements towards a much more detailed observation of the scenery in front or around the vehicle, multibeam antennas or scanning antennas have been designed, and solutions based on (digital) beamforming with a number of integrated antennas are in use or under development. General antenna concepts, partly including some system aspects, as well as three realized antenna configurations will be described in detail in this contribution.},

This is done by analyzing the discrete modal spectrum excited by a realistic source on or near an infinite microstrip line. A semi-analytical three-dimensional (3-D) Green's function is used for this purpose, which provides the current excited on the conducting strip due to the source. The 3-D Green's function is in the form of a spectral integration (inverse Fourier transform) in the longitudinal wavenumber plane. The poles of the integrand directly determine the excitation amplitudes of the modes on the structure that are launched by the source. The integrand also has different types of branch points, and the location of the poles on the various Riemann sheets is used to determine the physical significance of the leaky modes. Although the theory presented here is illustrated for a microstrip line, the conclusions apply in general to open printed-circuit structures},

abstract = {This sequence of papers presents an analytical closed form for the Green's function of an infinite slot printed between two different homogeneous dielectrics. This first part is devoted to the derivation of the slot magnetic current and to the discussion of the relevant physical implications. The Fourier spectrum of the magnetic current is derived by solving in analytical form, under small width approximation, the integral equation (IE) representing the continuity of the magnetic field trough the slot axis. The accuracy of the result is validated trough a fine meshing Method of Moments. From the consequent spectral expression, a closed form approximation of the leaky-wave propagation and attenuation constants is derived. An asymptotic expression for the current is also obtained by steepest descent path evaluation of the pertinent spectral integral. Analytical expressions of the quasi static (reactive) contribution is given for both elementary dipole and delta gap excitations.},

The microstructure is on a scale much less than the wavelength of radiation, is not resolved by incident microwaves, and uses a very low density of metal so that structures can be extremely lightweight. Most of the structures are resonant due to internal capacitance and inductance, and resonant enhancement combined with compression of electrical energy into a very small volume greatly enhances the energy density at critical locations in the structure, easily by factors of a million and possibly by much more. Weakly nonlinear materials placed at these critical locations will show greatly enhanced effects raising the possibility of manufacturing active structures whose properties can be switched at will between many states},

Two theoretical approaches are presented, one purely numerical and the other in network form and analytical in nature, that agree well with each other and with measurements in a special case.

abstract = {Abstract Computational studies of Maxwell's equations in complex geometries encountered in photonic band structure calculations run into difficulties when several length scales occur, such as the wavelength of light in free space and the skin depth in metal. These problems are remedied by using an adaptive co-ordinate system which expands or contracts length scales as necessary. Here we show that moving to a general co-ordinate transformation is equivalent to renormalizing $\epsilon$ and $\mu$. This is an huge simplification because now we need only write one computer code in a Cartesian system, and we can use this same code to handle any co-ordinate system by adjusting the $\epsilon$ and $\mu$ we feed into the calculation.},

As a result, 2-D range-azimuth images can be readily generated with a high refresh rate. The radar processing algorithm is developed and tested using point scatterer simulations. Stationary trihedral and human tracking measurements are carried out to demonstrate the concept. In addition, an L1-norm minimization algorithm is applied to improve the resulting resolution.},

@article{Jiang2014,
abstract = {A low-profile high-gain unidirectional antenna is proposed and demonstrated using both metamaterial (MM) and substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) technologies. First, the leaky modes supported by a grounded anisotropic slab are studied. These investigations reveal that a grounded slab consisting of an anisotropic zero/low index material can provide an extremely low value for the real part of the propagation constant of the leaky mode, thereby facilitating stable unidirectional broadside radiation over a wide frequency range. The truncation effect of the slab is then investigated through full-wave simulations, which is found to be beneficial for a practical implementation of dispersive metamaterials. Finally, to validate the proposed concept, a subwavelength end-loaded dipole array is designed to realize the required anisotropic zero-index property and is applied to a SIW fed longitudinal slot antenna for the 5.8 GHz wireless local area network (WLAN) band. Measurements of the fabricated antenna prototype are shown to be in strong agreement with simulation results, thus confirming the proposed antenna design. The resulting antenna is only 0.12 lambda thick, all while accomplishing a broadside gain of more than 10 dBi and a front-to-back ratio larger than 26 dB, which is similar to 7 dB and similar to 10 dB higher than that of the SIW fed slot alone, respectively. The -10 dB impedance bandwidth is more than 9{\%} both with and without the presence of the MM coating. The proposed technique offers a means for realizing low-cost and low-profile unidirectional antennas with moderate bandwidth.},

@article{Ma2010,
abstract = {Integration of transformation optics with development of metamaterials offers great opportunities to create exotic material with electromagnetic functionality absent from nature. It has already led to several significant advancements in physical conceptions and technological applications such as invisible cloaking. Unfortunately practical application is often restricted by the complex requirements on material properties imposed by the general optical transformation theory. It is therefore necessary to relax the stringent requirements of materials properties in order to practicably use the power of transformation optics to design exotic optical devices. De-velopment of new coordinate transformation mathematics to compromise between the stringent materials properties and the ultimate performance required by a useful novel device is required. In this work the authors employed strict conformal transformation to design physical materials that could guide light in a predeter-mined way. A simple and efficient numerical approach based on unusual inverse transformation is proposed here to quickly solve partial differential equations and construct the mapping relationship. The results showed that a transformed optical device could be made by purely using isotropic dielectric materials. Two application examples were numerically proposed to verify the versatility of conformal transformation and the robustness of the inverse approach. One was a 90° waveguide beam bend, and the other was a waveguide-type beam split-ter or coupler.},

Nevertheless, narrow bandwidths and high intrinsic losses arising from the resonant properties of metamaterials have raised doubts about their usefulness. New design approaches seek to turn the perceived disadvantages of dispersion into assets that enhance a device's performance. Here we employ dispersion engineering of metamaterial properties to enable specific device performance over usable bandwidths. In particular, we design metamaterials that considerably improve conventional horn antennas over greater than an octave bandwidth with negligible loss and advance the state of the art in the process. Fabrication and measurement of a metahorn confirm its broadband, low-loss performance. This example illustrates the power of clever implementation combined with dispersion engineering to bring metamaterials into their full potential for revolutionizing practical devices.},

We show that the directivity of this antenna is competitive with regard to conventional directive antennas (horn and reflector antennas), besides its dimensions are smaller. Numerical simulations using finite element method are performed to illustrate these properties. A reduction in the electromagneticmaterial parameters is also proposed for an easy fabrication of this antenna from existing materials. Following that, the design of the proposed antenna using a layered metamaterial is presented. The different layers are all composed of homogeneous and uniaxial anisotropicmetamaterials, which can be obtained from simple metal-dielectric structures. When the radiating source is embedded in the layered metamaterial, a highly directive beam is radiated from the antenna.},

TO is a general framework for solving inverse scattering problems based on mimicking spatial coordinate transformations with distributions of material properties. There are two essential steps in the design of TO media: first, a coordinate transformation that achieves some desired functionality, resulting in a continuous spatial distribution of constitutive parameters that are generally anisotropic; and, second, the reduction of the derived continuous constitutive parameters to a metamaterial that serves as a stepwise approximation. We focus here on the first step, discussing the merits of various TO strategies proposed for the long-sought 'invisibility cloak'—a structure that renders opaque objects invisible. We also evaluate the cloaking capabilities of structures designed by the related CM approach, which makes use of conformal mapping to achieve index-only material distributions. The performance of the various cloaks is evaluated and compared using a universal measure—the total (all-angle) scattering cross section.},

abstract = {Transformation electromagnetics is a systematic design technique for optical and electromagnetic devices that enables novel wave-material interaction properties. The associated metamaterials technology for designing and realizing optical and electromagnetic devices can control the behavior of light and electromagnetic waves in ways that have not been conventionally possible. The technique is credited with numerous novel device designs, most notably the invisibility cloaks, perfect lenses and a host of other remarkable devices.Transformation Electromagnetics and Metamaterials: Fundamental Principles and Applications presents a comprehensive treatment of the rapidly growing area of transformation electromagnetics and related metamaterial technology with contributions on the subject provided by a collection of leading experts from around the world. On the theoretical side, the following questions will be addressed: “Where does transformation electromagnetics come from?,” “What are the general material properties for different classes of coordinate transformations?,” “What are the limitations and challenges of device realizations?,” and “What theoretical tools are available to make the coordinate transformation-based designs more amenable to fabrication using currently available techniques?” The comprehensive theoretical treatment will be complemented by device designs and/or realizations in various frequency regimes and applications including acoustic, radio frequency, terahertz, infrared, and the visible spectrum. The applications encompass invisibility cloaks, gradient-index lenses in the microwave and optical regimes, negative-index superlenses for sub-wavelength resolution focusing, flat lenses that produce highly collimated beams from an embedded antenna or optical source, beam concentrators, polarization rotators and splitters, perfect electromagnetic absorbers, and many others. This book will serve as the authoritative reference for students and researchers alike to the fast-evolving and exciting research area of transformation electromagnetics/optics, its application to the design of revolutionary new devices, and their associated metamaterial realizations.},

The negative capacitors effectively cancel part of the dielectric constant within the waveguide to provide a broadband relative permittivity between 0 and 1. When used as a leaky-wave antenna, the beam angle is independent of frequency over a broad bandwidth because the waveguide provides a frequency-independent phase velocity greater than the vacuum speed of light. Thus, this approach eliminates beam squint, which is a primary drawback of passive leaky-wave antenna designs. Simulation results using ideal negative capacitors are presented, and the effects of causality are analyzed.},

To obtain closed-form formulas of EM parameters for an arbitrarily shaped concentrator, we employ nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) to represent the geometrical boundary. Using the conformally optical transformation of NURBS surfaces, we propose the analytical design of arbitrarily shaped concentrators, which are composed of anisotropic and inhomogeneous metamaterials with closed-form constitutive tensors. The designed concentrators are numerically validated by full-wave simulations, which show perfectly directed EM behaviors. As one of the potential applications, we demonstrate a way to amplify plane waves using a rectangular concentrator, which is much more efficient and easier than the existing techniques. Using NURBS expands the generality of the transformation optics and could lead toward making a very general tool that would interface with commercial softwares such as 3D STUDIOMAX and MAYA. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics},

@article{Yaghjian2008,
abstract = {Beginning with a straightforward formulation of electromagnetic 'cloaking' that reduces to a boundary value problem involving a single Maxwell first-order differential equation, explicit formulae for the relative permittivity–permeability dyadic and fields of spherical and circular cylindrical annular cloaks are derived in terms of general compressed radial coordinate functions. The general formulation is based on the requirements that the cloaking occurs for all possible incident fields and that the cloaks with frequency $\omega${\textgreater}0 have continuous tangential components of E and H fields across their outer surfaces, and zero normal components of D and B fields at their inner material surfaces. The tangential-field boundary conditions at the outer surface of the cloak ensure zero scattered fields, and the normal-field boundary conditions at the inner surface of the cloak are compatible with zero total fields inside the interior cavity of the cloak. For spherical cloaks, unlike cylindrical cloaks, these boundary conditions lead to all the tangential components of the E and H fields being continuously zero across their inner surfaces—cylindrical cloaks having delta functions in polarization densities at their inner surfaces. For H -wave incident fields, a nonmagnetic circular cylindrical annulus is found that has nonzero scattered fields but zero total fields within its interior cavity. For bodies with no interior free-space cavities, the formulation is used to derive nonscattering spherical and cylindrical 'concentrators' that magnify the incident fields near their centers. For static fields ($\omega$=0), the boundary value formulation is appropriately modified to obtain a relative permeability dyadic that will cloak magnetostatic fields. Causality-energy conditions imply that, unlike magnetostatic cloaking, electrostatic cloaking as well as low-frequency cloaking for $\omega${\textgreater}0 is not realizable. It is also confirmed that perfect cloaking over any nonzero bandwidth violates causality-energy conditions and thus the cloaking of realistic time-dependent fields must be approximate.},

Here we report the first experimental demonstration of an omnidirectional electromagnetic absorber in the microwave frequency. The proposed device is composed of non-resonant and resonant metamaterial structures, which can trap and absorb electromagnetic waves coming from all directions spirally inwards without any reflections due to the local control of electromagnetic fields. It is shown that the absorption rate can reach 99 per cent in the microwave frequency. The all-directional full absorption property makes the device behave like an 'electromagnetic black body', and the wave trapping and absorbing properties simulate, to some extent, an 'electromagnetic black hole.' We expect that such a device could be used as a thermal emitting source and to harvest electromagnetic waves.},

abstract = {Transformation electromagnetics provides a practical approach to control electromagnetic fields at will. Based on this principle, novel devices such as the invisible cloak have been proposed. Here we examine the extension of this technique as applied to the design of flat devices in antenna systems. A method using discrete coordinate transformation is proposed, which allows the conversion of conventional devices with curved shapes into flat systems, while preserving their non-dispersive, isotropic, broadband, and lossless properties. Two specific design examples, a flat reflector and a flat lens embedded in free space, are presented. To avoid the loss and narrow bandwidth issues typically present in metamaterials, appropriate approximations and simplifications are introduced to make the all-dielectric devices, which are more practical to build. It is also shown that the discrete coordinate transformation is valid for both the E and H polarizations, as long as the local coordinates of the system remain near-orthogonal. Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulations are used to verify the performances of these designs, and show that the all-dielectric devices have similar broadband performances compared to the conventional ones, while possessing the advantages of flat profiles and small volumes.},

The physical realization of these materials is also discussed in terms of embedding metallic nanoparticles and nanowires in a dielectric medium. In the limit of long wavelengths, these composites will behave like a homogeneous medium with zero permittivity that will completely reflect electromagnetic waves. We present transmittivity calculations by using finite-difference time domain for periodic structures that proves the concept and shows the validity of the long wavelength approximation. The striking result is that the cutoff frequency $\omega$ c is determined by the lattice parameter of the composite. By properly choosing the lattice constant of the composite and permittivity of metal and dielectric constituents, we can have full band gaps at any frequency range but especially in the visible.},

abstract = {Frequency independent fast-wave (FW) propagation with phase velocity greater than the speed of light can be ideally realized in a dielectric medium whose relative permittivity is positive, but less than 1. Conventionally, FW propagation is implemented by non-TEM waveguides or antiresonance-based metamaterials, which suffers from the narrow bandwidth due to the dispersion. In contrast, non-Foster circuits provide a brand new method for reducing the dispersion so as to broaden the bandwidth. This paper demonstrates broadband FW propagation in a microstrip line that is periodically loaded with non-Foster circuits. Discrete transistor-based non-Foster circuits functioning as negative capacitors are successfully designed with the novel modified negative impedance converter circuits. A -10-pF negative capacitor over a bandwidth of 10-150 MHz has been implemented. The fabricated circuits have been integrated into a microstrip line to form a FW waveguide. The retrieved phase velocity of the effective medium from the measured S-parameters characterizes a stable and causal FW medium with constant phase velocity of 1.2c from 60 to 120 MHz, and this has been further verified by Kramers-Kronig relations and the near-field measurements along the waveguide. In conclusion, a stable, causal, and broadband FW waveguide has been achieved by means of transistor-based non-Foster circuits. The implemented broadband FW propagation can potentially be applied in broadband leaky-wave antennas and cloaking techniques.},

The ray equations take into account the optical Magnus effect (spin Hall effect of photons) as well as trajectory variations owing to the medium anisotropy. Polarization evolution is described by the precession equation for the Stokes vector. In generic case, the evolution of waves turns out to be non-Abelian: it is accompanied by mutual conversion of the normal modes and periodic oscillations of the ray trajectories analogous to electron zitterbewegung. The general theory is applied to examples of wave evolution in media with circular and linear birefringence.},
