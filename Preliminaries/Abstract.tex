A broadband fixed-beam leaky-wave antenna is presented in this thesis. The proposed antenna consists of a graded dielectric superstrate placed on top of a closely-spaced thin slot array. The graded dielectric superstrate is designed using transformation electromagnetics to couple the radiation from underlying leaky slot-line into free space. Wave propagation in graded dielectric media, properties of leaky-wave antennas, and conformal transformation electromagnetics have been explored prior to the design. The behaviour of the proposed antenna has been subsequently improved through developing a technique that exploits transformation electromagnetics. The technique adjusts the discrepancy in phase produced as a result of coordinate stretching at the boundary of transformed medium. Full-wave simulations are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the leaky-wave antenna. Broadband radiation characteristics are achieved from the antenna with peak radiation around $33^o$, $30\%$ side-lobe level, $53\%$ back-lobe level, $30.6^o$ beamwidth, and $11.8$ directivity. Such performance makes the antenna suitable for planar applications where a fixed oblique beam is required over a broad bandwidth.
